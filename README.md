<h1>[2SecondRouteFinder] 간편 2초 경로탐색기</h1>

  <h3>Personal project [2019-4 - 2019-4]</h3>

<p>If you press where you want to go for 2 seconds, it tells you the route in an easy-to-read Korean format and shows you a simple polyline. When I was traveling in Thailand, there was a place I wanted to go nearby, but I didn't know how to get there, and I made it because I was frustrated with the uneven intervals of the buses.</p>
